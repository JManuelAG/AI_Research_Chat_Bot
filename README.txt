Folders inside

Code: This folder contains 3 scripts used 

- BERT_embedding_models: This is the approach 1, here you can find usage, testing, evaluation and deployment.
			This script ideally should be run in Colab.

- GPT_chat_models: This is the approach 2, here you can find usage, testing, evaluation and deployment.
		  This script ideally should be run in Colab.

- load_dataset: This script is used to showcase how the datasets are loaded into the HuggingFace Hub.
		This allows easier usage on Colab.
